## Monodomain simulations

To numerically solve the monodomain equation we use an open-source high-performance GPU solver called <em>MonoAlg3D_C</em>, which is publicly available at the following repository: 

- [MonoAlg3D_C](https://github.com/rsachetto/MonoAlg3D_C)

## Purkinje network generation

To generate the extra branches for the biophysically-detailed Purkinje networks we use the same Purkinje generation method given in <em>Berg et al. (2023)</em>, which is also publicly available in an open-source repository:
